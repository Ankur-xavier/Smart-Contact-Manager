**Smart Contact Manager**
This project is all about creating a smart contact management application.
We've used Spring Boot for the back-end, making it super efficient with features like authentication and authorization handled by Spring Security. 
On the front end, we've got a sleek interface thanks to HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, and Thymeleaf.
For the tech-savvy: Spring Data JPA takes care of database operations. 
It's a learning project, so we've followed the MVC architecture for a clean structure.
Dive in, explore, and let us know what you think!
